# button_pressing_simulator
A small clicker-style game about pushing a button

(Visit my github at github.com/Pixelbit1)
YOU WILL NEED PYGAME TO RUN THIS PROGRAM (visit pygame.org for more information)

I got bored one day and decided I wanted to make another game, so I made this one about pushing a button (a lot).
Push space to push the button, 1-9 to buy upgrades, and ENTER to upgrade the button.
Clicking on the screen will pull up the controls.
I may update this game, but I probably won't.

Programs used:
Thonny
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
Pygame

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code, just make sure to credit me.
